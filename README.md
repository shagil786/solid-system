# Implement a React component that represents a single item in a todo list. The component should display the todo's text and a checkbox to toggle its completed state. Additionally, it should have a button to delete the todo item.

## In This Project i had implemented the functionality given in the question itself.

# Write a MongoDB operation to update a specific todo item in a collection called todos. The operation should mark a todo item as completed by its ID

## db.todos.updateOne( { \_id: ObjectId("todo_id_here") }, { $set: { completed: true } } )
